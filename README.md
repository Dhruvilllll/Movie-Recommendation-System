# Movie-Recommendation-System

**Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System! This project uses machine learning and content-based filtering to suggest movies tailored to user preferences. It demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, NLP, similarity computation, and deployment.**

### ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Personalized movie recommendations

âœ… Content-based filtering using movie metadata (genres, keywords, cast, crew, etc.)

âœ… Cosine similarity and NLP-based similarity computation

âœ… Scalable and modular codebase

### ðŸ§  Tech Stack

**Programming:**	Python, Jupyter Notebook
**Libraries:**	Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pickle
**NLP:** CountVectorizer
**Data:** Kaggle

### ðŸ“Š Recommendation Logic
**Data Preprocessing:**

*Cleaned and combined relevant features like overview, genres, cast, crew*

*Converted text to lowercase, removed stopwords, and applied stemming*

**Vectorization:**

*Transformed text into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer*

**Similarity Calculation:**

*Used Cosine Similarity to compute distances between movies*

**Recommendation Engine:**

*Given a movie title, returns the top N most similar movies*

###  What I Learned

*Practical use of NLP and machine learning in real-world applications*

*Deploying ML models for end users*

*Importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering*

*Writing modular, clean, and reusable code*
